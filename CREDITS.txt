Reg was written by Martijn Faassen; the core mapping code was
originally co-authored by Thomas Lotze.

Reg is heavily inspired by ``zope.interface`` and ``zope.component``,
by Jim Fulton and a lot of Zope developers.

Reg development was partially funded by Contact Software (http://contact.de).

See also doc/history.rst for a more detailed history of its development.

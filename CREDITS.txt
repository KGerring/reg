Comparch was written by Martijn Faassen; the core mapping code was
originally co-authored by Thomas Lotze.

Comparch is heavily inspired by ``zope.interface`` and
``zope.component``, by Jim Fulton and a lot of Zope developers.

History according to Martijn
----------------------------

This code went through a bit of history:

The core registry (mapping) code was conceived by Thomas Lotze and
myself as a speculative sandbox project in january of 2010. It was
called ``iface`` then:

http://svn.zope.org/Sandbox/faassen/iface/

In early 2012, I was at a sprint in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany organized by
Novareto. Inspired by discussions with the sprint participants,
particularly the Cromlech developers Souheil Chelfouh and Alex Garel,
I created a project called Crom:

https://github.com/faassen/crom

Crom focused on rethinking component and adapter registration and
lookup, but was still based on ``zope.interface`` for the fundamental
AdapterRegistry implementation. I worked a bit on Crom after the
sprint, but soon I moved on to other matters.

At the Plone conference held in Arnhem, the Netherlands in October
2013, I gave a lightning talk about Crom and that made me think about
it again. I figured what Crom needed was a rewrite of the core adapter
registry, i.e. what was in the iface project. In the end of 2012 I
mailed Thomas Lotze asking whether I could merge iface into Crom, and
he gave his kind permission.

The core registry code of iface was never quite finished however, and
while the iface code was now in Crom, Crom didn't use it yet. Thus it
lingered some more.

In July 2013 in development work for CONTACT, I found myself in need
of a component architecture. Crom also had some new configuration code
intermingled with the component architecture code and I didn't want this.

So I reorganized the code yet again into another project, this one:
Comparch. I then finished the core mapping code and hooked it up to
the Crom-style API, which I refactored further. For interfaces, I used
Python's ``abc`` module.
